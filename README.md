# Facebook-Network-Analysis
This is an analysis of Facebook Network Dataset. This dataset consists of ’circles’ (or ’friends lists’) from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles) and circles. Facebook data has been anonymized by replacing the Facebook-internal ids for each user with a new value.

I took several methods to analyze this dataset, including PCA, K-means, PageRank and Louvain method.

To evaluate the effect, I considered scores of K-means, Modularity and Jaccard Similarity.
